<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Challenge to the Gods</h2>

<p>
A mere human challenges the gods stating that not even a god could make him fall in love. This has angered Zeus as he has never backed away from a challenge.
</p>

<p>
Aphrodite skulked along the massive halls of Mt. Olympus towards her husband's great workshop. An eerie stillness settled in; no chatter, no laughing, no joy, just cold marble. Always the same during times like these.
As she rounded a corner she noticed Zeus pacing back and forth in front of her. For a brief moment she thought of running; the scared girl inside of her thinking only of escape. That fleeting moment passed as Zeus turned towards her and approached. Aphrodite steeled herself, she was no child, she was a goddess. Her long, lithe form strode to meet the king of the gods half way.<br>
<br>
"Well?" He demanded more than asked. His eyes wide and bloodshot, teeth clenched and grinding, with a slight bit of froth forming at the corners of his mouth.
"It was an easy task," Aphrodite responded confidently. "No mortal man could possibly stand up to the compulsions of the goddess of love and beauty. I found him a suitable wife and made the two of them fall madly in love with each other. They married 3 moons ago and the wife is with child."
"Perfect! And today, what did you do today my dear?" Zeus smiled the smile of a fanatic; no humor or joy, only fervent devotion to a cause.

This was the hard part. The part Aphrodite had practiced and rehearsed for the past 3 moons. She would tell Zeus that she has decided to wait, to let them develop a deeper bond so when she does sever it the man will suffer all the more. Let her bear him children and let him fall in love with those children as well, only then will she take it from him.
