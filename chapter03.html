<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>The Wrath of Zeus</h2>

<p>
Zeus's hand shot forward and latched around Aphrodite's throat. Instinctively Aphrodite tried to reach up and pry the hand off of her throat but, as electricity coursed throughout her body, she found herself paralyzed. Her long and lithe form softened and shortened, her beauty appearing less as a proud goddess and more innocent and fragile. A defense mechanism designed to disarm her attacker, a change that Zeus entirely ignored. As her heart and diaphragm struggled to draw in and pump oxygen throughout her body, Zeus spoke.

"We conquered this world by challenging the Titans. The only reason we were able to challenge them in the first place was due to a moment of weakness from my mother Rhea." Zeus explained, his calm voice belying the rage underneath. "You know this, Aphrodite. We crush any and all challenges, we will not be thrown off ourselves."
"Father please, they aren't like us, they could never challenge us and hope to succeed. They aren't strong like us," Aphrodite managed to choke out, pleading with her father despite a nearly paralyzed jaw.<br>

A twitch of his lip sent more electricity through Aphrodite's body. Terror swept through her body as she realized no muscle in her body would work, as she realized she was dying. Ignorant or uncaring of her silent unnoticeable terror-stricken state, Zeus spoke again.<br>

"You will go back down there, and you will tear them apart. He will know loss and he will never experience love again, he will die broken and miserable. If you do not, next time I will not let go."
He tossed Aphrodite away, letting her broken body slump to the floor. Spasms wracked her body as deep hacking sobbing coughs over took her. By the time her body had recovered enough to take note of her surroundings, she was once again greeted only by cold marble.<br>
