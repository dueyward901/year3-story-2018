<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>The Wrath of Zeus</h2>

<p>
Zeus's hand shot forward and latched around Aphrodite's throat. Instinctively Aphrodite tried to reach up and pry the hand off of her throat but, as electricity coursed throughout her body, she found herself paralyzed. Her long and lithe form softened and shortened, her beauty appearing less as a proud goddess and more innocent and fragile. A defense mechanism designed to disarm her attacker, a change that Zeus entirely ignored. As her heart and diaphragm struggled to draw in and pump oxygen throughout her body, Zeus spoke.<br>
<br>
"We conquered this world by challenging the Titans. The only reason we were able to challenge them in the first place was due to a moment of weakness from my mother Rhea." Zeus explained, his calm voice belying the rage underneath. "You know this, Aphrodite. We crush any and all challenges, we will not be thrown off ourselves."
"Father please, they aren't like us, they could never challenge us and hope to succeed. They aren't strong like us," Aphrodite managed to choke out, pleading with her father despite a nearly paralyzed jaw.
A twitch of his lip sent more electricity through Aphrodite's body. Terror swept through her body as she realized no muscle in her body would work, as she realized she was dying. Ignorant or uncaring of her silent unnoticeable terror-stricken state, Zeus spoke again.<br>
"You will go back down there, and you will tear them apart. He will know loss and he will never experience love again, he will die broken and miserable. If you do not, next time I will not let go."
He tossed Aphrodite away, letting her broken body slump to the floor. Spasms wracked her body as deep hacking sobbing coughs over took her. By the time her body had recovered enough to take note of her surroundings, she was once again greeted only by cold marble.<br>
<br>
She disguised herself as a cloaked beggar just on the outskirts of the little village where the man and woman lived. She saw as the man and woman laughed and joked, she witnessed them lovingly discuss how their child would have his eyes and her smile, she nodded in agreement as they decided on names...Galen if he's a boy, Ariadne if she's a girl. For many days she watched a love far greater than any she had experienced blossom and grow.<br>
<br>
She thought of her husband, how he hid in his workshop unwilling to support her decision leaving her to her fate. She thought of her siblings and friends scurrying off into every dark nook and and crack when Zeus attacked her. How many witnessed what Zeus had done, she wondered. Hiding out of sight, every bit as paralyzed as her.<br>
<br>
Most of all, she thought of her father. She thought of his hand around her throat, how powerless she was to stop him. She thought of dying that way, murdered by her father for the crime of allowing two mortals a bit of happiness. She knew in her heart that he would, as well. His success mutated him into a paranoid fanatic; he was a monster.
She watched the man and woman, watched their love grow, and she grew cold. Her form hardened, lips thin and pursed, eyes cold and steely. Her beauty changed again; Not of a proud goddess nor of fragile innocence, hers was a cold, hard beauty. The beauty of a glacier cutting through the cold oceans of the north.
<br>
<br>
She watched as the woman glanced over towards a young farmhand. A cursory glance and nothing more, but all Aphrodite needed. She waved her hand once and left, to report to Zeus. She did not need nor intend to stick around and watch the outcome.
The woman glanced back at the farmhand as he looked up. Their eyes locked and cheeks flushed as they smiled warmly at each other.
