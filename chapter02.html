<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>Aphrodite Deception</h2>

<p>
It was a good lie. Not only was it believable, but it fed on Zeus's fanaticism. He would believe it and she would have plenty of time to figure something else out. Perhaps Zeus would eventually forget about the challenge, or maybe he would be satisfied and just assume Aphrodite would take care of things anyway. Hell, maybe some natural tragedy will befall the man and she could take credit. What a terrible thought.<br>
