<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>Aphrodite Deception</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>
It was a good lie. Not only was it believable, but it fed on Zeus's fanaticism. He would believe it and she would have plenty of time to figure something else out. Perhaps Zeus would eventually forget about the challenge, or maybe he would be satisfied and just assume Aphrodite would take care of things anyway. Hell, maybe some natural tragedy will befall the man and she could take credit. What a terrible thought.<br>
<br>
"I..." Aphrodite began shakily, the little girl in her creeping back to the forefront. "I didn't do anything. I watched them and they were happy and...I thought maybe it would be nice if they could stay happy."
<br>
<br>
It was a stupid lie. Zeus would never forget and would be all the angrier when her deception was discovered. Better to face him now than later.
For a moment Zeus simply stared as if not fully comprehending her words. Perhaps, Aphrodite thought, he was considering her words...a far better outcome than she had imagined.
